# AI Usage Report — Assignment 1

## 1️⃣ Tools Used & Use Cases

During this assignment, I used the following AI tool:

**ChatGPT**

### How I Used It

* Identifying and fixing coding errors in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* Assisting in implementing interactive features such as:

    * Navigation active section highlight.
    * Dark / Light theme toggle.
* Providing suggestions to improve layout, styling, and responsiveness.
* Reviewing my portfolio structure to ensure it matches the assignment rubric.
* Supporting documentation writing such as README and reports.

AI was used as a support tool to guide development and problem-solving, not to replace my own work.

## 2️⃣ Benefits & Challenges

### Benefits

* Helped quickly detect and fix coding errors.
* Provided design and layout improvement ideas.
* Supported implementing JavaScript interactivity features.
* Saved time during debugging and troubleshooting.
* Improved understanding of responsive design techniques.

### Challenges

* Some AI suggestions required significant modification to fit my project.
* Occasionally, when I followed ChatGPT recommendations directly, parts of my project stopped working or the overall layout became incorrect.
* AI sometimes generated solutions that were too complex for the assignment scope.
* Required careful testing and validation before applying changes.

## 3️⃣ Learning Outcomes

Using AI in this assignment helped me:

* Strengthen my understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript integration.
* Learn how to implement interactive features like scroll detection and theme toggling.
* Improve responsive design practices.
* Develop debugging and error-analysis skills.
* Learn how to critically evaluate AI outputs before applying them.
* Understand how to use AI as an assistant to support my own ideas, helping me implement them more easily and in a shorter amount of time.


## 4️⃣ Responsible Use & Modifications

All AI-generated suggestions were carefully reviewed, tested, and modified before implementation.

I ensured that:

* I requested help for specific parts of the project rather than generating the entire code.
* I fully understood the code provided before integrating it into my work.
* I tested all AI-generated solutions to verify functionality and compatibility.
* I improved and adjusted the code when needed to better match my design and assignment requirements.
* The final implementation reflects my own understanding, structure, and originality.

AI was used as a supportive learning tool while maintaining academic integrity and personal contribution throughout the project.
