## 🤖 Short Summary of AI Use

I used AI tools such as ChatGPT during this project to support my development process. AI helped me identify and fix coding errors in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, especially while implementing features like the navigation highlight and the dark/light theme toggle.

It also provided ideas to improve my portfolio design, layout, responsiveness, and user experience. In addition, I used AI to review my work and check if it matches the assignment rubric requirements. All suggestions were reviewed, tested, and modified to ensure the final implementation reflects my own understanding and work.
